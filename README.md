# Simplified RESTful Application with Thymeleaf for integration.

-To interact with data using REST API -> */jedis*
-To view all Jedi Knights that have been added, go for */jedis* as well
-In order to add a jedi by REST, make a POST request to */jedis/add* that includes **name** and **surname**
-To delete a jedi from the list, do a DELETE request to */jedis/'id'*, no data's needed to do so
-To edit, do a PUT request to */jedis/'id'* **name** and **surname** are needed
